      i took these photos in westwood in 2019, as a memento before i left UCLA. some of these are
      iconic buildings in the neighborhood, but most are just apartments that i liked and wanted to
      remember. i was particularly obsessed with all the dingbats that have survived in the 
      neighborhood, and wanted to photograph my favorites.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      the quaint little dingbats and mid-century apartments were never meant to last and few of
      those that remain are in good shape. at the same time, UCLA is continuing to grow (my first
      year it accepted more freshman than any other American university) and property values are
      continuing to rise. newer, bigger apartment buildings had already been built before i
      arrived, and plenty more properties were under construction. it's not an exaggeration to say
      that the neighborhood <i>i</i> knew lives on borrowed time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      so i think of this collection as a bit of a memorial, a memento mori even, of the parts of
      westwood that i knew and loved.
