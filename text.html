      Lotuses in the Mud: House-Temples in Little Saigon

      <em>
      I can feel the familiar itch of a mosquito bite beginning to spread across the back of my
      hand. We’re standing in the backyard of my mom’s coworker’s home, a beautiful garden lush 
      with flowers and a serene pond, undoubtedly the breeding ground for the mosquitoes attacking
      us on this humid summer day. Cô Uyên notices my excessive scratching and rubs the back of her
      neatly shaved head. “They always get me too,” she laughs, “my head makes an easy target.”

    <p>
      Cô Uyên’s house is both a home and a temple. It is a space for gathering, visiting, praying,
      eating, sleeping, and living. And in our hometown of Garden Grove, California, at the heart 
      of Orange County’s Little Saigon, there are many more like it. These “house-temples,” as we 
      call them, are scattered across the city in the homes of Vietnamese Buddhist monks and nuns 
      like Cô Uyên, who, whether out of a lack of resources to build more formal temple buildings 
      or out of a simple sense of neighborliness, have transformed their single-family residences 
      into functional gathering and ritual spaces. These residences also operate as central places 
      from which monks and nuns offer charitable and educational services. In doing so, 
      house-temples reimagine the single-family house as something far removed from its intended or
      historical uses. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging more of necessity than by intention, the vast majority of house-temples are 
      undocumented in any official capacity, making it difficult to track their history 
      definitively. However, from what we know of the city’s history and our experiences living in
      it, we can assume that the first house-temples appeared in conjunction with the development 
      of Little Saigon in the mid- to late-1970s, following the Fall of Saigon and the arrival of 
      Vietnamese refugees to the United States en masse. After an initial wave of refugees 
      relocated to the affordable neighborhoods along Bolsa Avenue in Westminster, Little Saigon 
      gradually expanded north into Garden Grove. Practicing Buddhists of limited means found that 
      the predominantly white neighborhoods of these cities lacked a Buddhist community. In the 
      absence of existing temples or the resources to build them, the houses of local monks and 
      nuns provided a necessary alternative.

      This alternative is not without its own costs, and the lives of house-temples are constantly 
      influenced by financial difficulties. Cô Uyên, for example, expressed the difficulty for 
      monks and nuns in providing for themselves (monks and nuns in Little Saigon often work 
      full-time jobs outside of their devotion), as well as the determination that all money gifted
      to her and her temple be redistributed through charitable service. These financial 
      difficulties, along with the desire of many Vietnamese Buddhists to visit monks’ residences 
      and be in the presence of wise and devout mentors, provide very practical motivations for the
      development of these houses into more persistent gathering spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Little Saigon has grown alongside further waves of immigration, house-temples continue to
      emerge across the region, even alongside the establishment of larger, traditional temples. 
      House-temples are so firmly embedded in Vietnamese-American neighborhoods that even 
      non-Buddhist Vietnamese-Americans are familiar with and can often identify them in passing. 
      Because the existence of these structures is so common, Vietnamese-Americans will most 
      commonly refer to a house-temple as a “chùa,” the Vietnamese word for temple. There has been 
      little practical need to distinguish between a formal temple and a house-temple, and 
      therefore there is no standard term for the “house-temple.” It is our hope that through this 
      research we can understand these homes as neither house nor temple, but as something else. In
      doing so, we might begin to challenge our assumptions and see the single-family home as a 
      space open to reimagination.

      <em>
      And so, it’s on this hot mid-June morning that we find ourselves standing in front of Cô 
      Uyên’s residence, a house-temple in Garden Grove. Located on the edge of a cul-de-sac just 
      two miles from my parents’ house and shouldering a busy street that parallels the Garden 
      Grove Freeway, her house is one that I’d driven past hundreds of times but had never noticed
      before. After ringing the doorbell, we stand at the front door for a few minutes 
      contemplating whether or not we had the right address, but the image of a lotus flower on the
      gate confirms that we are at a Buddhist residence. We call Cô Uyên, who instructs us to enter
      through the unlocked gate to the backyard.
