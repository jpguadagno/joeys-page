	“I am interested in finding the boundaries and connections and intersections between
	things… I find where these forms come together and then I try to open up the in-between
	spaces.”<span style="color:tomato;"><sup>1</sup></span> Rosa Barba is an artist that evades 
	easy classification. Her practice, while undeniably rooted in film, touches on a wide variety
	of things—of media, of genre, of facts and fictions. The work, both defined by and expressed 
	through film, is never satisfied by the quick consumption of images on a flat screen, but 
	rather demands an attention to space and landscape. Barba’s art can best be understood through 
	two categories: the physical, in which film is understood as an object engaged with machinery 
	and light, i.e. “sculpture” <span style="color:dodgerblue;">(Fig. 1)</span>; and the 
	conceptual, in which film is a projected sequence of images, i.e. “movies” 
	<span style="color:gold;">(Fig. 2).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
	Yet even these two categories are never absolute, for Barba’s interests lie in expanding
	our definitions of space. In her dissertation, Barba presents her work as part of an on-going
	project “that regards cinema in an architectural sense but also as a tool. Here, the 
	environment, the screen, and the projection can be combined or pushed forward to create 
	another	spatiotemporal dimension that is concurrent with and beyond the context of interior 
	or exterior space. Uncertainty and speculation exist within this expanded 
	space.”<span style="color:tomato;"><sup>2</sup></span> Thus, her films must be understood as 
	equally concerned with the physical space of the celluloid and projector as with the 
	conceptual space of the filmed image itself, and even with the imagined spaces which exist 
	between and beyond them.
      </p>
      <p>
	For the purposes of this paper, however, I will endeavor to limit myself to the “movie”
	side of Barba’s work—the cinematic side, or perhaps more adequately what is filmed and how it
	is presented. Barba’s interest in the liminal spaces of cinema means that her films are uniquely
	situated within the architectural imaginary. She employs with great craft a variety of
	techniques—including genre, narrative, audio, and editing—which reposition the filmed
	landscape from a landscape of reality to one of fiction, or perhaps even hyperreality. <i>Somnium</i>
	(2011), a film which simultaneously engages the documentary and science fiction genres to this
	end, can be considered a primary example.<span style="color:dodgerblue;"><sup>3</sup></span>
