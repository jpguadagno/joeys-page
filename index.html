<!-- Hi, welcome to my website. I built it myself.
You can do a lot with html and css, and the basics are easy to learn. 
w3schools.com is a good place to start, but here's a breakdown of my site. -->

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Joey's Page</title>
	
<!-- Above is stuff to set up your html file as an html file.
"title" is where you put the name of your site (for browser tabs) -->
	
<!-- Below contains CSS. Most websites will have a separate file for CSS,
but a very basic site like this can include it in the "head" section. -->
	
<!-- The code below simply defines how links appear on my page. -->
	
<style>	
a:link {
  color: white;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:visited {
  color: white;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
  color: grey;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:active {
  color: black;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}
</style>
	
</head>
	
<!-- The "body" section is what you actually see on your page.
"style" here will set the default look for your entire page. -->
	
<body style="background-color:black;font-family:helvetica;color:white;">
	
   <header style="max-width:960px;margin:auto;padding:2vw;">
	   
   <!-- Sometimes it's helpful to organize your page into sections.
   My "header" section contains a title and some text. -->
	   
   <!-- Since I want my website to scale to different resolution screens, I often use "vw" (viewport width) for units.
   I've told the header to never scale bigger than 960 pixels wide.
   The "margin" outside the header will automatically fill in the rest of the space and center my content.
   The "padding" sets space around the content inside of the header so that it won't touch the edge of the screen.
   I've set the padding to 2% of the width of the viewport. -->

	    gua<span style="color:dodgerblue;">•</span>da<span style="color:gold;">•</span>gno</span>
	 </p>
	   
	 <!-- "p" means paragraph and contains text. I'm using it for a title. -->
	   
         <!-- "span" is used to style text inline, eg make a few characters/words different instead of the whole paragraph.
         Here I'm using it to add color. -->
	
	 <p>
	    <br />
		 
	    <!-- "br" is a line break. -->
            
	    <!-- Now's probably a good time to mention that breaks and spacing in your code won't necessarily show up on your page.
            You have to code those things, too. -->
		 
            <!-- There's probably cleaner ways of spacing my text, but it's a quick way to put a break between these paragraphs. -->
